# grimoire
Grimoire is an (unfinished) dice pool calculator for spells in Mage: the Awakening 2nd edition. 
It was done as an experiment to work with TypeScript and React in the browser. Currently, there is
a barely functional command line client that can validate spell definitions and produce basic dice
pool numbers, when the right data is input.
